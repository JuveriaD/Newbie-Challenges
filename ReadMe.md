# Frontend Mentor Newbie Challenges
 ### [frontendmentor.com](frontendmentor.com)
#### FEM community on slack helped me a lot, when I started with Frontend developer journey I was stuck on just HTML and CSS (without any layout practice), because I didn't had any mentor to let me know my mistakes and what should I practice and what are the best practices, but then I found this site with best community support which helps you with roadmap, resources, projects, feedback on projects and many more..âœ¨
